# WebPrint

WebPrint is a website that can be used to print files. A user can drag and drop
a file in the UI and let it be printed.

The project should be deployable on any device (or at the very least any Linux
environment) by invoking a single script.

Technologies:
1. Vertex (backend Java server component)
2. Angular 4 (frontend UI component)
3. Docker (put the project in a container)
4. CUPS (for sending the actual command to the printer)
